### Some information about me

I am a passionate QA engineer with some small but important experience in this field. (By the way, I love finding bugs in real lifeâ€” for example, people with the same name: is it a bug or a feature?) Seriously speaking, I am a motivated and meticulous specialist with a keen interest in software testing processes, aiming to improve product quality and prevent problems from occurring.
